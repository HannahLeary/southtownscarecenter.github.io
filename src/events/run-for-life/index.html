						<p><a class="text-hdg" href="http://www.runforlifewny.com/">Run For Life WNY 5k Run &amp; Walk</a> is dedicated to raising funds to benefit organizations in WNY who help women choose life for their unborn child. Past beneficiaries have included Son Rays Ministries, 40 Days for Life, and LifeSavers. Through the use of sponsorships to cover expenses, runners can be assured that 100% of their registration dollar is given to the beneficiaries.</p>
						<p>This year all registration monies will be donated to the Southtowns Care Center. The event features a USATF sanctioned and certified 3.1 mile route on which we welcome both runners and walkers. Strollers are permitted. Families are welcome and encouraged to join in this fun event!</p>
