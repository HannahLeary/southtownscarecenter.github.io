							<p>Abortion rates in Erie County are unbelievably high at 39.1 per every 100 live births, according to the Department of Health. We at Southtowns Care Center want to see those numbers go down by providing free services and alternatives to women considering their pregnancy options. We desire to be the hands and feet of Jesus to these women and their families. Please join us for our first major fundraising event as we are working towards procuring a location and opening our doors. Bring a lawn chair and enjoy awesome free music by the Wesleyan Church of Hamburg's worship team, have some food from local food trucks, hear inspiring testimonies from local women who have experienced unwanted pregnancies, and light up the beach with luminaries, symbolic of God's light in the Southtowns of Buffalo. Put your shock and horror into action and support our center while also having a fun family night out.</p>
