							<h2>The need for a pregnancy resource center in the Southtowns is significant.</h2>

							<p>Pregnancy tests at Tops in Hamburg are literally kept under lock and key due to theft. The shame of an unplanned pregnancy in a clean and upstanding community is enormous. By joining together, we can support and encourage women and their families during pregnancies and after. It is our desire to see women choose life; however, regardless of their choice, our ultimate goal is that they would experience the love of Christ during a difficult and emotional time in their lives.</p>

							<h2>Mission &amp; Vision</h2>

							<p>Southtowns Care Center, Inc. (SCC) exists to be the the hands and feet of Jesus to women considering their pregnancy options. We will minister the love of Christ and speak words of life to the hearts and minds of our community in the Southtowns of Buffalo by:</p>

							<ul>
								<li>Offering compassionate guidance from trained peer counselors.</li>
								<li>Providing free pregnancy tests.</li>
								<li>Providing accurate and truthful information.</li>
								<li>Offering hope and healing through abortion recovery groups.</li>
								<li>Helping individuals consider the sanctity of life and understanding the benefits of sexual abstinence and purity.</li>
								<li>Being an emotional and spiritual support for women and their families.</li>
								<li>Existing as a resource for the community and Christian leaders.</li>
								<li>Operating with the highest standards in order to uphold the name of Jesus Christ and to love others as He first loved us.</li>
							</ul>
