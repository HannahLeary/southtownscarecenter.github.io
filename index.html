								<h2>The need for a pregnancy resource center in the Southtowns is significant.</h2>

								<p>Pregnancy tests at Tops in Hamburg are literally kept under lock and key due to theft. The shame of an unplanned pregnancy in a clean and upstanding community is enormous. By joining together, we can support and encourage women and their families during pregnancies and after. It is our desire to see women choose life; however, regardless of their choice, our ultimate goal is that they would experience the love of Christ during a difficult and emotional time in their lives.</p>
